# Intro

I am a software engineer at [Mobile Programming](https://www.mobileprogramming.com/). I have been outsourced to [Eclerx](https://eclerx.com/) where I build Backend application to store and analyse Adidas business data accurately and quickly. My primary job is to optimise the architecture design and  DB queries to reduce the response time. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Eclerx, I have learned how to build backend application, teams, manage people, develop relationships with team,with technologies like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I primarily work as a Backend engineer but have broad experience across Market360 Adidas stack.

# Some history

- My parents and I were not much aware about Computer science even when I was 18, As per my friends computer science engineering was something which could make richer as Mark zukerberg so I was successful in convincing by family to get me admitted into 4 years course of computer science engineering.

- When I was 21, I completed my graduation and got an internship role in [Chicmic](https://www.chicmic.in/). I worked   with Javascript and c++ with gaming engines [Cocos](https://www.cocos.com/) [Unity](https://unity.com/) for the first 6 month of my internship where I worked on many interesting games [Ludo Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nazara.chicmic.ludo&hl=en_IN&gl=US), [The humble miner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thehumbleminer.game&hl=en_IN&gl=US) [Witchland bubble shooter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qwertygames.witchland&hl=en_IN&gl=US).
